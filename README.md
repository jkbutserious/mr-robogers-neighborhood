#### Looping and Branching Exercise, 6.12.2020

#### By Jeff Kim

## Description

This program accepts user input in the form of numbers and returns the input to the user, with the following exceptions:

* All returned numbers that contain a 1 are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
* All returned numbers that contain a 2 are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
* All returned numbers that contain a 3 are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
* These exceptions are recognized in order of importance from least to most (3, 2, 1) and only the most important exception should be returned

## Specs

1. Code should recognize user input numbers and return a sequence of numbers from 0 to the user's number
Example Input: "4"
Example Output: "0 1 2 3 4"

2. Code should reject non-numeral input
Example Input: "C1"
Example Output: "Please input a number"

3. Code should replace all returned numbers that contain a 1 with the string "Beep!"
Example Input: "5"
Example Output: "0 Beep! 2 3 4 5"

4. Code should replace all returned numbers that contain a 2 with the string "Boop!"
Example Input: "6"
Example Output: "0 Beep! Boop! 3 4 5 6"

5. Code should replace all returned numbers that contain a 3 with the string "Won't you be my neighbor?"
Example Input: "7"
Example Output: "0 Beep! Boop! Won't you be my neighbor? 4 5 6 7"

6. Code should replace all returned numbers containing 2 or more exceptions as the appropriate string in descending order of importance
Example Input: "13"
Example Output: "1 ... 9 Beep! Beep! Boop! Won't you be my neighbor?"

7. Code should clear previous output when user submits a new number
Example Input: "1" -> "2"
Example Output: "Boop!"
